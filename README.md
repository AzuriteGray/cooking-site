# Simple cooking site


The idea for the site was to make a website with 3 dishes on it, a starter, a maincourse and an dessert.
I chose this specific subject because of my background in cooking and it seemed like a nice starting point.
I have also tried to do as much as possible with just HTML and CSS since I havnt learned anything about JavaScript yet



## UX

The focus of the UX was to make it simple and straight forward

you arrive on the site in the header you can see a link to the recipes, all recipes have a photo of the finished dish before you click on it and you can when you click on it you will be taken to a list of ingriedients and a step by step list


## Features

### home page

- navbar          - allows you to skip to certain parts of the home page
- recipe links    - allows you to visit each recipe shown by name and photo
- About us music  - lets you listen to spotify music while cooking

### recipe pages

- navbar          - lets you go back to homepage and the part of the homepage youd like to be at
- video           - shows a video of food being sauteed


## Technologies Used

Bootstrap 3.3.7 from www.getbootstrap.com
    to create the basic layout of the website
    
Java by bootstrap from www.getbootstrap.com
    To make the website more mobile friendly
